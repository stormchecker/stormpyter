    "## Optimal bias to find a coffee place\n",
    "Members of the **Random Walk Circle** may approximate a city as a two-dimensional grid and argue that randomly moving through town will ensure that they find coffee.  \n",
    "One member of the Random Walk Circle, we call them JPK, adores random walks but wants to use a probabilistic model checker to optimize the bias of the four-side die that he will use for moving through town.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The (parametric) MC.\n",
    "We model JPK as an agent which has a latitude  ($x$) and a longitude ($y$), and an orientation in a grid-like city with streets in a perfect grid shape and all roads going either north-south or east-west. The town is bordered by four canals that cannot be crossed.  \n",
    "At every crossing, JPK decides to go with likelihood $p_W$ west, with likelihood $p_E$ east, with likelihood $p_N$ north and with likelihood $p_S$ south. \n",
    "JPK initially starts at a hotel quietly located far from the conference venue. It is known that there are two coffee places of sufficient quality in town, named **Cotton & Coffee** (CC) and **Katoen & Koffie** (KK). These coffee places must be on one of the main squares and based on prior knowledge, JPK has a distribution over their locations. The result is a parametric MC (pMC), as depicted partially in [1,Figure 10]. We want to highlight that pMCs models that use rational functions as transition probabilities are somewhat rare in the literature: The use of polynomials is more standard.\n",
